  NOTE: THIS VERSION'S DEVELOPMENT IS IN HIATUS UNTIL HUGGING FACE CAHCES R1 FOR INFERENCE APIs
</h1>

I was tired of getting grossed out watching unexpected scenes in movies and TV and losing my appetite, that's why I created TREAT.

The goal of this project is to empower viewers by forewarning them about potential triggers in the content they watch, making the viewing experience more enjoyable, inclusive, and appropriate for everyone.

TREAT is a web application that uses natural language processing to analyze movie and TV show scripts, identifying potential triggers to help viewers make informed choices.

## To-Do List

- Test the model with cached model using API

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank:

- Hugging Face: For providing the limited free API to use generously 

- DeepSeek AI : For developing and allowing open access to the DeepSeek R1 model, a very critical component of this project.

- Parasite (2019): For that unexpected jumpscare that ruined my appetite and ultimately inspired this project.
